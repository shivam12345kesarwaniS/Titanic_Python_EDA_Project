ðŸš¢ Exploring the Titanic: An Adventure in Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my Titanic EDA project! This was an exciting dive into the world of data, where I set out to unravel the hidden stories within the Titanic dataset. It's not just about numbers; it's about understanding the people and events behind them.

What's Inside:

I've taken a close look at who the passengers were â€“ their ages, genders, and classes.
I've delved into the survival rates, trying to make sense of the factors that influenced who made it and who didn't.
Along the way, I've used data visualizations to paint a vivid picture of the Titanic's journey.
I encourage you to explore the code, charts, and insights I've gathered in this project. Let's connect with the past, remember the lives touched by this historic event, and learn from it. Your thoughts, suggestions, and contributions are always appreciated! âš“
